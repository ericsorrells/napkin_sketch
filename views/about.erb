Challenging architects to express themselves on a dinner napkin can be viewed as a somewhat sadistic exercise. Who are you, in sixteen square inches or less?

The responses are a kind or Rorschach test. The idea that emerges on the napkin as the victor from an inner struggle of self-identification, while hardly a definitive portrait, reveals something about the values and goals of the creator. The range of expression on these pages includes architecture as building for humans, and as a form of abstract sculpture, artistic renderings, statements of self-conscious (why am I doing this exercise?), statements on the meaning of architecture, whimsical renderings of this or that, and, my favorites, small commentaries on human interaction. Of course, as I just demonstrated, reacting to these doodles also reflects on the viewer.
  
Whatever their meaning, sketches by talented people tend to be magical and ... are often beautiful

So, when trying to communicate in a situation where words alone won’t work, think about creating a napkin sketch. It’s a great visual way to make the abstract concrete, the intangible tangible, and the unfamiliar familiar.

   Napkin Sketch is a look at the process by which designers go from the conceptual, to the concrete, from idea to finished product. Take a look at the napkin sketches for each of the architectural projects shown, and see how they compare to the realized building....
